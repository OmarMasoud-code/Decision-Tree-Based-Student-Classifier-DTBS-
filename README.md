# Decision Tree Based Student Classifier (DTBS)

This project implements a basic student classification system using decision trees. It analyzes input attributes like grades or attendance and classifies students into categories based on defined thresholds. The code is written in Java and provides a foundational example of using decision trees for educational data mining.
